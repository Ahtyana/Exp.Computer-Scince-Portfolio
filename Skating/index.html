    Firsts things first, when I say I like skating, it's not skateboarding. It's Rollerskating or Rollerbladeing. No one specific really inspired me to do it, I kinda just went along with it after seeing so many
    got insparation from randos from videos and watching others do some pretty cool tricks. I'm bound to do some risky stuff and maybe even get hurt but it'll be worth it.
    I'm just ready to get back to doing risky but fun tricks.
