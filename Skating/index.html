   Rollerbladeing is just very fun, that's how we're starating this. No one specific really inspired me to do it, I kinda just went along with it after seeing so many
    got insparation from randos from videos and watching others do some pretty cool tricks. I'm bound to do some risky stuff and maybe even get hurt but it'll be worth it.
    I'm just ready to get back to doing risky but fun tricks. 
Rollerblading is also fun to do with my dog. He's the sweetest pitbull you'll ever meet. And when we go around, he just pulls me and I get to have even 
more fun time with him. He's so squishy and fat, it's adorable.
 I also, just for the sake of keeping myself alive with humor, I like to annoy my cat. All I have to do is skate around and he'll just run and i find it funny
 because then two second later, he'll come back and forget that he was running for his lives.
By the way, my cat's name is "Garfeild". He's the literal definition of the cartoon. But he could use more brown.
